Goal: Predict Volatility in the coming week
    Volatility: a change on 5% on more inside 7 days

Data
    DownLoad Data
    create 

Model:
    Desired Indicators (at least 10):
        ***Spread: high-low for the days (need Scale Factor)
        Open Price (% change against previous open) 
        Close Price (% change against previous close)
        ***Volume (need Scale Factor)
        Volume (% change)
        
Stage 0: Build a Model that probably wont work
    Get the data (check)
    define Volatility
        label each day as either 0 if spread for next 7 days is <5% or 1 if spread is greater
    Scale basic attributes against their max values

Stage 1: add additional attributes
